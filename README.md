# Home-Credit-
A description of the analytical process.  

Summary of business problem and project objective:

Home Credit faces a challenge due to its unique lending model, catering to a wider demographic range compared to conventional lenders. This necessitates the evaluation of alternative default indicators for loan extension decisions. The project aims to identify key default indicators and develop a predictive model to mitigate defaults, thus optimizing Home Credit's financial performance.

Your group's solution to the business problem:

Our group opted for a capboost model over traditional gradient boosted decision trees. Capboost was chosen for its ability to handle categorical variables with less processing and automatic hyperparameter tuning. The model categorizes borrowers into three groups: low-risk borrowers eligible for automatic approval, those requiring loan officer assessment, and automatically denied applicants.

Your contribution to the project:

Primarily, I contributed to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the creation of our presentation. Employing data preprocessing methods I utilized for handling missing values, I also integrated animations and slide designs, drawing inspiration from the "Death by PowerPoint" TED talk.

The business value of the solution:

Our analysis demonstrates significant cost savings by reducing the need for manual intervention by loan officers. Through risk assessment and categorization, the model streamlines the loan approval process, allowing loan officers to focus on cases requiring their expertise.

Difficulties that your group encountered along the way:

A notable challenge stemmed from language disparity among group members, with my preference for R while others used Python. Translating my R-based preprocessing methods into Python proved time-consuming and required collaboration to ensure seamless integration.

What you learned in the project:

The project underscored the importance of group dynamics, emphasizing the necessity for all members to grasp each aspect of the project. Late realization of this fact, exemplified by a member's delayed contribution to the presentation, highlighted the need for comprehensive understanding among team members. Additionally, proficiency in multiple languages and tools beyond one's expertise proved invaluable for effective collaboration.
